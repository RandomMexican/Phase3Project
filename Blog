Hello so the way this project works is when ran it opens a GUI with buttons leading to different simulations 

![Alt text](image.png)

Clickin on any of the buttons should load a new window with the respective simulation 

First up is SandGrav.py that starts a simulation where the user can spawn small balls everytime they click, or zoom in/out on a trackpad which spawns multiple at once, that have physics so they fall to the ground and pile up it does lag after a small chunk of balls are spawned and im not sure why.


The second sim is ConWays Game of Life
